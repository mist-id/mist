## Dependencies

The only dependency you need to install is [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/); everything else is managed by it.

## Setting everything up

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory**.

```bash
gh repo clone mist-id/mist && cd mist
```

2. **Start the development environment**. This may take a while the first time as it downloads all dependencies.

```bash
devbox shell
```

3. **Copy over the env config**. Be sure to set `AUTHN_BASE_URL` to your local IP address if you plan
   on testing the authentication flow with another device.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Start Mist and external services**.

```bash
just dev
```

5. **Create a tenant for users to sign up to**. The created service will use the example service
   for its authentication flow.

```bash
just seed
```

### Running the example service

```bash
just example
```

### Testing

To test the authentication flow, you'll need an SIOP-enabled app.
Any should work, but development has so far been done using [Sphereon Wallet](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/mobile-wallet) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sphereon-wallet/id1661096796), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphereon.ssi.wallet&hl=en_US)).
