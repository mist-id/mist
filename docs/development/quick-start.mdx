title: Quick start
---

Mist is built on a suite of emerging technologies. Some resources to help get an understanding
of it all can be found in the [reading material](/development/reading-material). Beyond that, working knowledge of Rust is benefecial.
If you're new to Rust, the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great place to start.

## Dependencies

You'll need to have [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com) installed; all other dependencies
are managed by devbox. If you'd rather run your development environment yourself,
have a look at [devbox.json](https://github.com/mist-id/mist/blob/main/devbox.json) for a list of dependencies.

## Setting everything up

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory**.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mist-id/mist.git && cd mist
```

2. **Start the development environment**. This may take a while the first time as it
   downloads all dependencies.

```bash
devbox shell
```

3. **Copy over the env config**. Make sure to edit the required values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Start Mist and external services**.

```bash
just dev
```

5. **Create a tenant for users to sign up to**. You'll need to provide your local
   IP address to allow Mist to communicate with the demo service (see below)

```bash
just seed 10.0.0.125
```

### Testing

To test the authentication flow, you'll need an SIOP-enabled app.
Any should work, but development has so far been done using [Sphereon Wallet](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/mobile-wallet) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sphereon-wallet/id1661096796), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphereon.ssi.wallet&hl=en_US)).

**You'll also need to run the demo service**. Once again, be sure to edit the required values.

```bash
cp demo/.env.example demo/.env

just demo
```
