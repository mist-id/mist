## Dependencies

The only dependency you need to install is [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/); everything else is managed by it.

## Setting everything up

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory**.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mist-id/mist.git && cd mist
```

2. **Start the development environment**. This may take a while the first time as it
   downloads all dependencies.

```bash
devbox shell
```

3. **Copy over the env config**. Make sure to edit the required values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Start Mist and external services**.

```bash
just dev
```

5. **Create a tenant for users to sign up to**. You'll need to provide your local
   IP address to allow Mist to communicate with the demo service (see below)

```bash
just seed 10.0.0.125
```

### Testing

To test the authentication flow, you'll need an SIOP-enabled app.
Any should work, but development has so far been done using [Sphereon Wallet](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/mobile-wallet) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sphereon-wallet/id1661096796), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphereon.ssi.wallet&hl=en_US)).

**You'll also need to run the demo service**. Once again, be sure to edit the required values.

```bash
cp demo/.env.example demo/.env

just demo
```
