Mist is built as what's sometimes called a [modular monolith](https://www.kamilgrzybek.com/blog/posts/modular-monolith-primer).

## Components

Each component is a Rust crate that lives in the Mist monorepo.

| Component  | Description                                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **runner** | The entry point, responsible for starting apps from components that export axum routers. |
| **api**    | The REST API, used by the Service to manage the Mist instance.                           |
| **authn**  | The authentication service, responsible for user authentication.                         |
| **jobs**   | Handles the execution of background jobs.                                                |
| **db**     | The data layer, used by all components to store data.                                    |
