title: Quick start with Docker Compose
---

You can run Mist alongside your application locally using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
An [example](https://github.com/mist-id/mist/blob/main/local/docker-compose.yml) is provided.

## Getting it up and running

1. **Set a master key**. Realistically, you'd want to store this somewhere safe.

```bash
MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

2. **Download the example Docker Compose file and run it**.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/mist-id/mist/blob/main/local/docker-compose.yml

docker-compose up
```

3. **Create a service**. This is the application you want users to sign in to. You can find out more about the service API [here](/api-reference/services).

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: ${MASTER_KEY}" --raw-data \
    '{ "name": "ACME", "redirect_url": "...", "logout_url": "...", "webhook_url": "..." }' \
    localhost:9001/services
```
