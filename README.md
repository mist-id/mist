> **Mist** is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform designed to bridge the gap between emerging technologies within the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) space and traditional web applications.

## Overview

### What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)?

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a model for managing digital identities where an individual or business has sole
ownership over the ability to control their accounts and personal data. Key concepts include:

- **SIOP (Self-Issued OpenID Provider)**: A protocol allowing users to authenticate using their own identity provider.
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Unique identifiers that enable verifiable, decentralized digital identity.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Claims made by an issuer about a subject that can be cryptographically verified.

### Project Goals

The vision is to simplify the integration of Self-Sovereign Identity technologies into traditional applications.
Mist aims to:

1. Lower the barrier to entry for developers wanting to implement SSI in their projects.
2. Provide a seamless, user-friendly IAM experience built on SSI principles.
3. Increase adoption of SSI technologies by offering an easy-to-use, robust solution.

### Current State

I have a working prototype with basic functionality, but it is not yet feature-complete or production-ready. **Breaking changes are expected**.

Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/mist-id/projects/1) to see what's planned.
